# What is this?

This is my first Hello World example of pushing code how to a Raspberry Pi, I really had problems figuring out how to add the images, but I get it now.  

# How do I add an image?

On the right side, in Solution Explorer, Click Assets, right click the folder and Choose Add, then Add new.  You'll get a file explorer window, where you can provide the path to an image.  To add an image, draw it on the screen and then select the new image from the 'Source' Dropdown on the image properties.

# What's it look like?

I thought you'd never ask!
